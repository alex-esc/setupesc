# autohotkey experiments by alex-esc

Here you will find experimental shortcuts and functions later to be implemented on the keybinds.ahk script.

I use this subfolder as my playground and will not provide binaries for these experiments, if you want to compile and try them out yourself then continue reading:

## How to compile / how to get .exe files

1. Install Autohotkey (restart if needed)
2. Download or clone this repository
